## Site Goals

- Intonation Ladder is an ear training game. Competence hearing and comparing pitches is fundamental to the ability of a musician. Intonation Ladder measures how well a player can recognise a pitch that is slightly sharp or flat.

- This skill can help musicians tune their instruments, play in tune and rectify tuning issues. As the margin between sharp and flat narrows, they can easily be mistaken. Ear training can make a remarkable difference at helping musicians in this area.

- The webpage is simple, interactive and focused on the task at hand. Layouts, instructions and responses are clear and intuitive, with a bright and positive design. An ascending ladder animation represents progression and success. Familiar icons guide the player into action or provide information and help when needed.

- Intonation Ladder contains 1000 pre-recorded audio files. Each one consists of two notes played on the piano, with the second note slightly sharper or flatter than the first. The audio files are selected at random and grouped into levels or 'cents'. 1 cent = 1/100 of a semitone. The game becomes progressively more difficult as a player's score increases. The maximum possible score is 100, with the last three questions containing pitches just 1 cent apart. 

- It is anticipated the site can be expanded by linking it to social media groups. Highscores could then be shared, create group competitions and promote the site.

- Intonation Ladder would sit well alongside other ear training games in a music education website. It could be marketed to school music classes as a fun and effective way of improving listening skills.

- The site is compatible and responsive to all screen sizes.

  - The layout adapts to different screen sizes. Interactive 'flat' and 'sharp' buttons are positioned in the area of a player's thumb, keeping the score and progress info visible further up the screen.

- ### Design

- #### Logo

  - The Intonation Ladder logo was designed using Canva. Its main font is 'Fredoka' interspaced with familiar sharp/flat music symbols replacing the 't's and 'b's. These were created using the 'Opus Plain Chords Std' font on Microsoft Word, exporting them as images and inserting them into the logo. 

  - The name and logo is an important way a new user can quickly see and understand the purpose of the game. The two words 'intonation' and 'ladder', encapsulate all the game is designed to do, with the familiar sharp and flat symbols reinforcing the definition of the word 'intonation'.

- #### Colour scheme

  - Intonation Ladder's color scheme was selected from various palette options provided on Canva. The bright scheme, based on primary colours, provides a distinctive and memorable brand in the style of a children's game. This helps the game feel encouragingly simple (despite a high score being rather difficult). Players feeling like this is a game rather than a test are more likely to keep playing and improve further.
